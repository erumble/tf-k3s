    # Create a [self signed](https://cert-manager.io/next-docs/configuration/selfsigned/) cluster issuer
    This whole module could be a `kubernetes_manifest` resource, but the CRDs have to exist _before_ the Terraform plan runs.

    This module creates custom resources defined by cert-manager, and should have a dependency on the cert-manager module.

    Usage
    ---
    ```
    module "self_signed_cluster_issuer" {
      source = "./modules/self-signed-cluster-issuer"

      depends_on = [
        module.cert_manager
      ]
    }
    ```
